The best I found was the following:
https://telekomhilft.telekom.de/t5/Telefonie-Internet/VoIP-Desaster-geloest/td-p/2373435
But this took me quite a while to get it successfully applied to my snom300 desk phone.

Find the 2 images with my settings, which finally worked for me; no further tabs changed.

Notes:
The 'Displayname' and 'Account' are two times the same phonenumber, which you want to use (typically one out of the three phone numbers you got from Telekom).
In my case, the 'Password' was not the given one from Telekom, but the one I had chosen before.
Use 'Zugangsnummer' as part of the Authentication Usernamne, which forms that eMail as 'Authetication Username'.
Ignore the 'Anschlusskennung' as it is not used nor required here, nor the 'Mitbenutzernummer'. 
Ignore as well your 'Kundennummer' as not needed here. 

Enjoy a quick setup of your IP phone ....
